# Quantum Computing 
## A quantum computer is a machine that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations; instead of using bits and logic gates as current compters, quantum computers use qubits and quantum gates. Qubit is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.

# Cirq
Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and then running them against quantum computers and simulators. Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of abstracting them away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime, these details determine whether or not it is possible to execute a circuit at all.
